# UT Dallas - CS 6375 (Machine Learning) - Exam Solutions

This repository contains solutions for past CS 6375 exams in LaTeX and PDF format.

## Rules

### Be Helpful to Others

Submitted solutions must include all reasonable steps and be **easy to follow and understand**, even for the weakest among us.

### Be Consistent with Others

Mathematical notation, choice of indices, presentation style should be consistent.

### Be Accountable to Others

Each solution to each problem must be submitted for peer review and approved through the Pull Request process. Submit a new PR for every question's solutions. If you take issue with a solution (i.e., believe it is incorrect, think it needs additional details, etc.), create an issue, discuss with others, and submit a PR with your changes.

### Be Tidy for Others

The only files to be committed, without exception, are as follows.

```
~/readme.md
~/.gitignore
~/.vscode/extensions.json
~/exams/<exam-name>/<exam-name_solutions>.tex
~/exams/<exam-name>/<exam-name_solutions>.pdf
```

This means no image files, extra notes, etc.
